My name is Ryan Place and I am a M.S. Bioinformatics student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I also work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a contracted microbiologist through IHRC, Inc. At the CDC I work in the Viral Vaccine Preventable Disease Branch on developing a high-throughput immunocolorimetric neutralization assay for Varicella-Zoster Virus. I also have experience with BAC cloning and plaque reduction neutralization assays through work on J virus and PIV5 during my time at the University of Georgia. During my time at the CDC, I have witnessed the necessity of bioinformatics in biological studies and how bioinformatics is at the vanguard of pushing the study of biology into the future. Therefore, when I decided that I wanted to continue on with my education I knew that I had to pursue bioinformatics because of my desire to be on the cutting edge and help expand scientific understanding. The research I am most interested in is predictive modeling, whether that is using NGS data to predict genetic changes in infectious diseases, predictive molecular modeling, or modeling biological pathways.
