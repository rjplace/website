I am a M.S. Bioinformatics student at Georgia Institute of Technology. I also work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as a microbiologist contractor through IHRC, Inc. At the CDC I work in the Viral Vaccine Preventable Disease Branch on developing a high-throughput immunocolorimetric neutralization assay for Varicella-Zoster Virus. I also have experience with BAC cloning and plaque reduction neutralization assays through work on J virus and PIV5 during my time at the University of Georgia. Once I started working at the CDC it became apparent to me that the amount of biological data being generated was staggering, and there needed to be more people working When I decided that I wanted to continue on with my education I knew that I had to pursue bioinformatics because of my background with microbiology and interest in computer science. The research I am most interested in is predictive modeling, whether that is using NGS data to predict changes in infectious diseases, molecular modeling, or modeling biological pathways.
